# 99 Luftballons
A project that uses threads to create imaginary balloons.  
  
Balloons are created in factories and then they are transported using transporters to storages.  
  
If more than 99 balloons are stored in local storage at the same time, the balloons are released.  
  
Emergency release of balloons is marked with animation of balloons flying in the sky.
